# California Housing Price Prediction üè†

This project develops and deploys a machine learning model to predict California housing prices. It covers the entire MLOps lifecycle from data exploration and model training to containerization and cloud deployment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust model capable of predicting median house values in California districts, leveraging a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Key Project Phases & Technologies

### 1. Data Analysis & Exploration üìä

- **Data Source:** California Housing Prices dataset (from `sklearn.datasets`).
- **Initial Analysis:**
  - Exploration of population distribution across districts.
  - Geographic visualization of housing prices versus population density.
  - Visualization of price categories for better contextual understanding.

### 2. Model Development & Training üß†

- **Feature Engineering/Preprocessing:**
  - **Outlier Removal:** Applied clipping (0.05/0.95 lower and upper bounds) to mitigate the impact of outliers on model performance.
  - **Data Splitting:** Data was split into training and testing sets for robust evaluation.
- **Model Selection & Training:**
  - **Base Model:** Linear Regression (used as a baseline).
    - **Note on Scaling:** For Linear Regression, features were scaled. This is crucial for Gradient Descent-based optimization, as it makes the cost function more spherical, enabling faster and more direct convergence to the global minimum, especially crucial for quick optimization.
  - **Advanced Models:**
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost
- **Overfitting Mitigation:**
  - Initial training revealed overfitting issues in both Random Forest and XGBoost.
  - **Regularization:** Grid Search Cross-Validation was employed to tune hyperparameters and apply regularization, improving model generalization.
- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Models were evaluated using key regression metrics:
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE) on both training and test sets (`train_mse`, `test_mse`).
    - R-squared (Coefficient of Determination) on both training and test sets (`train_r2`, `test_r2`).
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test set (`test_mae`).
- **Best Performing Model:** **XGBoost** demonstrated the best performance after hyperparameter tuning and regularization.

  | Model   | Test MSE | Test R¬≤ | Test MAE |
  | ------- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
  | XGBoost | 0.46     | 0.8382  | 0.31     |

### 3. Model Persistence & API Development üì¶

- **Model Pickling:** The best-performing XGBoost model, along with relevant results and metadata, were serialized using Python's `pickle` module for later use.
- **Flask API (`app.py`):**
  - Developed a lightweight Flask application to serve the trained model as a web API.
  - Implemented a `/predict_api` endpoint capable of accepting new housing features (via JSON POST requests) and returning price predictions.
- **Web Interface (`home.html`):**
  - Created a simple HTML frontend to provide an intuitive user interface for entering housing features and receiving predictions directly in the browser.
- **API Testing:** Thoroughly tested the API using Postman to ensure correct request/response handling and model inference.

### 4. Deployment üöÄ

The application is deployed using a modern cloud-native approach.

- **Render (Platform as a Service - PaaS):**
  - Leveraged Render's seamless GitHub integration for **automatic deployments** on every push to the `main` branch.
  - Utilized a `Procfile` (`web: gunicorn app:app`) to instruct Render on how to run the Flask application using Gunicorn, a production-grade WSGI server.
  - **Overcame Deployment Challenges:** Successfully debugged and resolved common dependency-related issues on cloud environments, including problems with Windows-specific packages (`pywin32`, `pywinpty`) and build process errors (`maturin` / `cargo` related to read-only file systems) by carefully managing `requirements.txt` and `runtime.txt`.

* **Dockerization (Containerization):**
  - The project is also dockerized using a `Dockerfile`. This encapsulates the application and all its dependencies (Python interpreter, libraries, model files) into a portable container.
  - **Dockerfile Instructions:**
    - `FROM python:3.10.4`: Based on a specific Python version image.
    - `COPY . /app`: Copies all project files into the container's `/app` directory.
    - `WORKDIR /app`: Sets `/app` as the working directory.
    - `RUN pip install -r requirements.txt`: Installs all Python dependencies inside the container.
    - `EXPOSE $PORT`: Informs Docker that the app listens on a dynamically assigned port.
    - `CMD gunicorn --workers=4 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app`: Defines the command to run the Gunicorn server when the container starts.

### What to Expect from Predictions:

- **Higher `MedInc`**: Generally leads to a higher predicted price.
- **Coastal locations (e.g., Bay Area, LA, San Diego)**: Tend to result in higher predicted prices.
- **Newer houses (lower `HouseAge`)**: Will likely predict slightly higher prices.
- **More rooms, fewer occupants (`AveRooms` vs. `AveOccup`)**: Often correlates with higher predicted prices.
